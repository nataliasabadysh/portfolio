          "I am a big fan of React and its rendering, modularity, and ease of implementation with any tool. It's smart in the techniques it has under the hood, easy to use in development tools and extensions, and has a big community that is growing and getting better. Today, React is turning to React Server Component, which I find more exciting. It allows us to split the logic and have calculations, storage, and security stored on the server, and receive ready HTML with SEO-optimized components. There are many tools that integrate with React today, like Figma and many more.",
