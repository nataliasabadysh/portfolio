          What does it mean to be a Senior Web Developer ?

        <p>
          I got my first Senior position after a year of working with React in
          2019, because I am eager and really good at logical structuring on the
          client side and creating reusable, scalable, safe, and reliable
          applications, able to estimate and deliver on time.

          Today, after a year of working, my passion still lies in UI Web

          with businesses and having an impact, with a strong focus on business,
          strategy, value, and missions.

          Being as a Senior Web Developer I learned how to develop with a wide

              I am eager to take on projects, continue building new features,
              and maintain and support existing applications. Build feature
              end-to-end, work as independent responsible developer or with a

              I am enthusiastic about building brand-new applications from

              consistency, reusability, and ease of understanding. I focus on

              I can configure and set up any Web Development tool and set up the
              environment for deployment processes. If there is something I

              from documentation.

              I am conformable to help designing UI ad features and interviewing

              I can mentor junior positions by sharing patterns, functions, and
              code that we already use, explaining the cases and practices, and
              demonstrating the benefits. This helps them catch up, contribute
              to the process, and learn through open communication, and other
